        <h3> Description</h3>
            <p>A variation of Irish Soda Bread, Viking Soda Bread was a staple for Noresmen and Vikings.</p> 
            <p>Bread was a staple of the diet.  A person's place in the village hierarchy determined what 
            type of bread you ate. </p>
            <p>The slaves would eat flatbreads cooked on a griddle-type pan over a fire. 
                Bread slightly risen would have been for the richer Vikings.
